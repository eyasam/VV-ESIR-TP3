# Mocks to the rescue

The classes `SSLSocket`, `TLSProtocol` and `TLSSocketFactory` are included in the `sockets` package of the [`tp3-ssl`](../code/tp3-ssl) project.

The test class `TLSSocketFactoryTest` tests `TLSSocketFactory` and manually builds stubs and mocks for SSLSocket objects.

Rewrite these tests with the help of Mockito.

The initial tests fail to completely test the `TLSSockeetFactory`. In fact, if we *entirely* remove the code inside the body of `prepareSocket` no test case fails.

Propose a solution to this problem in your new Mockito-based test cases.

### Problem :

The main issue with the `TLSSocketFactoryTest` tests is that they fail to properly verify the behavior of the `prepareSocket()` method. Specifically, they do not check if `setEnabledProtocols()` is called or what arguments are passed. Using anonymous implementations of the SSLSocket interface renders the tests fragile and incomplete. As a result, if the `prepareSocket()` method is emptied, the tests still pass, failing to assess its core functionality. 

### Solution :

To solve the problem, we can **rewrite the tests using Mockito to mock the SSLSocket interface** and verify **interactions** with it. 
First, we **mock the socket** to control the return values of getSupportedProtocols() and getEnabledProtocols(). 
Then, using Mockitoâ€™s verify() method, we **ensure that setEnabledProtocols()** is called with the correct arguments or not when protocols are null. 

We can expand the test cases to cover different scenarios, such as :
- Verifying that the method correctly handles cases where both supported and enabled protocols are provided (typical), ordering the enabled protocols according to their precedence.
- Testing when the socket reports no supported protocols.
- Checking cases where unsupported or invalid protocols are included in the list to confirm that they are filtered out properly.
